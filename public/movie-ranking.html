<h2>My Top Three Favourite Movies</h2> 

<hr />

<h3>1. Zack Shniders Justice League.</h3> 

<h4>Remarks:</h4>

<p>I feel this is the best representation of what a superhero movie should be. Plus Martian Manhunter is in it.<br /> 
Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince try to bring the metahumans of Earth together after the death of Clark Kent.<br /> 
Meanwhile, Darkseid sends Steppenwolf to Earth with a vast army to subjugate humans.<br /></p>

<h3>2. Planet of the Apes.</h3>

<h4>Remarks:</h4>

<p>I love the story in the triology and the CGI acting is impecable. Definetly top 5.<br /> 
Complex sociological themes run through this science-fiction classic about three astronauts marooned on a futuristic planet<br /> where apes rule and humans are slaves. 
The stunned trio discovers that these highly intellectual simians can both walk upright and talk.<br /> They have even established a class system and a political structure. 
The astronauts suddenly find themselves part of a devalued species, trapped and imprisoned by the apes.<br /></p>

<h3>3. A quiet place.</h3>

<h4>Remarks:</h4>

<p>I love the setting and how the characters have had to adjust to not making any sound and sound-proofing their home.<br /> A new take on monsters in movies.<br /> 
A family lives in a world inhabited by blind but sound sensitive creatures who are out to kill people.<br />  
In order to survive, they are forced to use the sign language to communicate with each other.<br /> </p>
